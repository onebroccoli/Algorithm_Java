/*
Given two sorted arrays A and B.
We can pick one element a from A and another element b from B,
and their sum s is defined to be s = a + b.
Find the k-th smallest s from all possible values of s.

Example:

A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {4, 8}

The 1st smallest s is 1 + 4 = 5

The 2nd smallest s is 3 + 4 = 7

The 3rd and 4th smallest s are both 9 (1 + 8, 4 + 5)

The 5th smallest s is 3 + 8 = 11
